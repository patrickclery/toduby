## Getting Started

## Requirements

* PostgreSQL *or* Docker (depending which method you choose)

### Method #1: Running Rails on your machine

1. Clone this repo to your local machine:

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/patrickclery/toduby.git
```

2. From the command-line, cd into the directory:

```shell script
cd toduby
```

 If you are using `rvm_autoupdate_flag=1` in your `~/.rvmrc`, this will automatically install Ruby 2.6.5. Otherwise, run it manually:

```shell script
 rvm install
```

_Note: Using RVM is optional, just make sure you have Ruby 2.6.5 available._

3. Run the setup script. This does several things:
- Installs bundler (if necessary)
- Installs the required ruby gems
- Prepares your database
- Seeds your database

```shell script
bin/setup
```

### Method #2: Docker

1. Fire up Docker on your local machine
2. Run this command to build and deploy the app:

```shell script
docker-compose --env-file=.env up
```

_Note: .env is generated by `bin/setup` but you can create one using the sample .env.sample_

3. Be sure that your Docker container publishes port 3000 (manually required).

### Method A: Running the Rails server on your system.

1. Fork the repo.

2. Run the setup script.

    ```shell script
    bin/setup
    ```
    This does several things:

    - Installs the required ruby gems and JavaScript packages.
    - Prepares your database:
        - Creates the databases
        - Seeds the data
    - Creates a .env file with default settings

### Method B: Docker

1. Fire up Docker on your local machine
2. Run this command to build and deploy the app:

    ```shell script
    docker-compose --env-file=.env up
    ```

    _Note: .env is generated by `bin/setup` but you can create one using the sample .env.sample_

3. Be sure that your Docker container publishes port 3000 (manually required).

### Method C: Deploy to Heroku (in a Docker container)

1. Install heroku CLI on MacOS:

    ```shell script
    brew tap heroku/brew && brew install heroku
    ```

2. Deploy the app on Heroku (this requires a heroku.com account.) You will want to enable "Automatic Deploys" for your _master_ branch.

    ```shell script
    heroku git:remote -a your-heroku-subdomain-goes-here
    heroku stack:set container
    git push heroku master
    ```

3. The app should be up & running on your Heroku subdomain. If not, you can debug any errors by checking the build long (under the "Activity" tab on Heroku), or tailing the logs:

    ```shell script
    heroku logs --tail
    ```

## Start the server and use the app.

1. Run this command in a terminal window to start both Rails and your React frontend.

```sh
foreman -f Profile -c -p 3000
```

2. Open the app in your browser by navigating to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
